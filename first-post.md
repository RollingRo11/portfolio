# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post! Let me test out some features.

## Markdown Support

Here's some **bold text** and *italic text*. I can also create lists:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And numbered lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## LaTeX Support

Let's test inline math: $E = mc^2$

And here's a block equation:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

Here's another complex equation:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla^2 u$$

## Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
    return 42

# This is a comment
result = hello_world()
```

That's all for now! More posts coming soon.
